# Final
This is my final assignment for the Multiverse Data Science Apprentiship
This code will implement a pipeline to unzip password protected zip files, and extract the data to the server where the files were found.  

# Phase 1: 
Implement a data pipline to add automation to the file extraction and conversation from csv to excel.
# Phase 2: 
load the extracted data into an sqlite database
# Phase 3: 
Categorise the comments to apply sentiment
# Phase 4: 
Add topic categorisation (possibly bag of words)
